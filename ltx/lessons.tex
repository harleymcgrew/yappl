\begin{itemize}
\item Everyone needs to be able to work independently and be productive. But joint coding sessions have a lot of benefits too. Not only does it force everyone to set aside some time to work on the project for a few hours, but everyone can provide each other with immediate feedback and help with debugging, figuring out how to implement something etc. These factors tend to make such group sessions very productively. 
\item Unit tests are amazing. There's a good reason software engineers use them. Particularly in the middle of the development process, writing even 2 or 3 non-trivial tests is pretty much guaranteed to find at least one bug.

\begin{itemize}
\item The LRM is always authoritative and reliable--- {\it except when it's not.} Then, it needs to be corrected. Testing is largely validating that your language follows the LRM, but part of testing is  also verifying the completeness  and consistency of the LRM. 
\item Don't forget to test for parsing and compilation errors you {\bf want} to happen. If you only test the output of well-formed programs, you won't find out that your compiler happily compiles invalid code into a meaningless blob of executable gubbins.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf On Getting a Head Start}\\
It is, of course, easy for everyone to say ``start early.'' It's similarly easy to think ``ok, we're going to start early.''  It's definitely harder to actually get started as early as you intend. Some ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create some deadlines early on for your team for meeting and creating some initial tests, and skeletal implementations of your compiler. 
\item Send email to the  team about the project when the discussion goes quiet. It can be about anything: questions you have, or when the next meeting is occurring. Don't wait for your leader or others to send an email; often your activity will motivate or oblige your team members to become active as well.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf Choose something you care about}\\
Or at least choose something that you find interesting. It will make the whole experience much more fun!
