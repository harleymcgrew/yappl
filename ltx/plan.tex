\subsection{Process}

The initial planning and specification phase took place during in-person weekly meetings. Real-time collaboration was achieved with a whiteboard as well as Google Docs (in-person and remotely). Everyone contributed to the high-level language design.\\\\
A Git repository on GitHub was used for version control and code storage. Individually, various text editors were used for development. The compiler was written in OCaml and compiles down to OCaml.\\\\
Tests were started early and each team member contributed to the test suite as modules were completed. A test script was used to quickly run all tests during development.

\subsection{Style Guide}

Two spaces per tab\\\\
Value\_and\_type\_names\_with\_underscores\\\\
Modules And Constructors With First Letter Uppercase\\\\
TOKENS\_ALLCAPS\\\\
Pattern matching lines and other logical groupings kept aligned

\subsection{Tools and Languages}
OCaml was used for the compiler and bash scripts for testing and building. Various text editors were used for writing code. Git was used for version control. Email and Google Docs were used for remote discussions and real-time collaboration.
